# 要记住历史，不要记住仇恨

19世纪末20世纪初，中国仍处于封建社会末期，科技落后，国力衰微。彼时的日本，虽文化根源深植于中华，却因地理资源匮乏，萌生了"帮助中国现代化"的想法。  

*In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, China was still in the final stage of feudal society, lagging in technology and declining in national strength. At that time, Japan, though culturally rooted in China, was short of natural resources and developed the idea of "helping China modernize."*

起初，他们在东北等地确实进行了一些建设。然而，随着野心膨胀，一些政治人物开始视中华民族为劣等，进而产生了取而代之的狂妄之念。日本军国主义的侵略，实则源于其扭曲的民族主义和对资源的贪婪渴望。这场浩劫给中国及其他亚洲国家带来了难以磨灭的苦难。  

*At first, they did carry out some construction in Northeast China and other areas. However, as ambitions grew, some politicians began to view the Chinese nation as inferior, leading to an arrogant desire to replace it. Japan’s militaristic aggression stemmed from distorted nationalism and a greedy thirst for resources, bringing unforgettable suffering to China and other Asian countries.*

战争以原子弹的惨烈落幕。作为战胜国，中国本有权在日本驻军，却选择了宽容与和解，展现了大国胸怀。  

*The war ended tragically with atomic bombs. As a victorious nation, China had the right to station troops in Japan, but it chose tolerance and reconciliation, demonstrating the magnanimity of a great nation.*

上世纪70年代末，邓小平领导下的中国迫切需要外资和技术助推经济发展。邓小平访日，以谦逊亲和的姿态恳请日本来华投资。随后，日本成为中国重要的经济伙伴，投资如潮水般涌入。各地兴建日资产业园区，为日籍员工安居乐业，还建设了日本学校、中日友好医院等设施。这段蜜月期有力证明，国与国之间的关系能够超越历史恩怨，实现互利共赢。  

*In the late 1970s, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China urgently needed foreign capital and technology to drive economic development. Deng Xiaoping visited Japan, humbly and amicably requesting Japanese investment in China. Subsequently, Japan became a major economic partner, with investments flowing in like a tide. Japanese-funded industrial parks were established across China, providing for Japanese employees' well-being, along with the construction of Japanese schools and the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital. This period of cooperation strongly proved that relations between countries could transcend historical grievances to achieve mutual benefit.*

然而，近年来随着中美关系趋紧，加之美日同盟关系密切，一些官方媒体有意渲染对日情绪。这种做法虽可能短期内凝聚民心，长远来看却有百害而无一利。最近发生在苏州的日本小学生校车遇袭事件，以及胡友平女士为保护日本儿童而不幸牺牲的悲剧，引发了日本社会的恐慌。日企连夜撤离中国的举动，无疑对当前经济下行、失业率居高不下的中国雪上加霜。  

*However, in recent years, as Sino-American relations have tightened and the U.S.-Japan alliance remains strong, some official media have intentionally stirred anti-Japanese sentiment. While this may unite the people in the short term, it will bring only harm in the long run. The recent attack on a Japanese school bus in Suzhou, where Ms. Hu Youping tragically died protecting Japanese children, has caused panic in Japanese society. Japanese companies' overnight withdrawal from China only adds to the woes of an already slowing economy and rising unemployment in China.*

安倍晋三曾在2015年的国会演讲中表示："我们不能让子孙后代一出生就背负道歉的重担，即便他们与战争毫无关联。尽管如此，我们每一代日本人都必须正视过去的历史。"他感谢中国战后"以德报怨"的宽容，也感谢西方国家愿意与日本共同面向未来。这番言论被视为日本"向前看"政策的起点。这一政策并非否认历史，而是呼吁不要让国家永远活在历史的阴影之中。  

*In a 2015 speech in the Japanese parliament, Shinzo Abe stated: "We cannot burden future generations with the responsibility of apology the moment they are born, even if they had nothing to do with the war. Nevertheless, each generation of Japanese must face up to the history of the past." He thanked China for its post-war tolerance of "repaying evil with virtue" and also thanked Western countries for their willingness to move forward with Japan. His words were seen as the starting point of Japan’s "forward-looking" policy, which was not about denying history but rather calling for the nation not to be forever trapped in its shadow.*

反观中国，我们似乎正陷入一个危险的循环。对许多中国人而言，战争历史不仅未曾过去，反而成为了一种持续的现实。更令人担忧的是，一些人正在以"爱国"的名义，重复着历史上我们曾极力反对的行为。  

*On the other hand, China seems to be caught in a dangerous cycle. For many Chinese, the history of the war is not something that has passed, but a persistent reality. Even more worrying is that some are repeating behaviors in the name of "patriotism" that we once vehemently opposed.*

这种情况令人不寒而栗。那些打着爱国旗号，煽动仇恨、伤害无辜的人，他们的行为与当年的侵略者何其相似。他们可能不自知，但正在成为和平的破坏者，成为他们曾经憎恨的那种人。这种扭曲的"爱国主义"正在侵蚀我们社会的根基，破坏来之不易的和平与繁荣。  

*This situation is chilling. Those who incite hatred and harm innocents in the name of patriotism resemble the aggressors of the past. They may be unaware, but they are becoming destroyers of peace, turning into the very type of people they once despised. This distorted "patriotism" is eroding the foundation of our society, undermining the hard-won peace and prosperity.*

我们必须警惕，这种狭隘的民族主义情绪很可能成为操纵民意、转移国内矛盾的工具。它不仅无助于解决任何实际问题，反而会加剧国际关系的紧张，最终损害我们自己的利益。  

*We must remain vigilant. This narrow-minded nationalism could easily become a tool to manipulate public opinion and divert attention from domestic issues. It will not help solve any real problems but will instead escalate tensions in international relations, ultimately harming our own interests.*

更可怕的是，这种仇恨情绪一旦蔓延，就如同打开了潘多拉的魔盒，难以收拾。它会毒化我们的下一代，让他们带着偏见和敌意去看待这个世界。这与我们追求和平、开放、进步的理想背道而驰。  

*Even more frightening is that once this hatred spreads, it will be like Pandora’s box, impossible to contain. It will poison our next generation, causing them to view the world with prejudice and hostility, which is contrary to our ideals of peace, openness, and progress.*

我们不应忘记南京大屠杀幸存者李秀英老人的嘱托："要记住历史，不要记住仇恨！"这句话如今悬挂在侵华日军南京大屠杀遇难同胞纪念馆的新展厅里，警醒着每一位参观者。这不仅是对过去的反思，更是对未来的期许。  

*We must not forget the words of Nanjing Massacre survivor Li Xiuying: "Remember history, but don’t remember hatred!" This quote now hangs in the new exhibition hall of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, reminding every visitor. It is not only a reflection on the past but also a hope for the future.*

我们必须保持清醒，爱国不等于仇外，应该用理性和智慧去看待历史，用开放和包容的心态拥抱世界。勿忘国耻是让我们努力学习、提升自己，为国家发展贡献力量，而不是沉溺于狭隘的民族主义情绪中，不要成为仇恨的传播者。  

*We must remain clear-headed. Patriotism does not equal xenophobia. We should view history with reason and wisdom, and embrace the world with openness and inclusiveness. "Remembering national humiliation" should inspire us to study hard and improve ourselves, contributing to the country’s development, rather than wallowing in narrow nationalism and becoming spreaders of hatred.*
